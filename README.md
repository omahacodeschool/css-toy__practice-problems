# CSS Exercises

Each exercise contains some starter HTML and a blank **global.css** file for you to type the CSS for that exercise.

There is also a file **_framework.css**, which you should not edit. It's some necessary styling to get the exercises set up, including a graphic which is that exercise's goal. That way, you can compare the evolution of your CSS-based design to the goal for that exercise.

To work on these exercises, we suggest setting up Chrome with the Web Inspector open to the following layout:

The left-most column, where the actual webpage is being viewed, should be **exactly** 430px wide. That is the width that the goal-graphics were made to fit.

For all of the exercises, do not make any changes to the HTML except for the following:

- You may add add classes to HTML elements (although no assignment should require this)
- You may add blank lines/spacing for organization/readability
- You may modify the classes on the `<body>` element to toggle the display of the goal graphic
- You may add "clear" `<div>`s as needed

No other changes to the HTML in an exercise are allowed.

Each **global.css** file does have a small bit of starter code: The `font-family` declarations that will be needed for that exercise. These are provided, because otherwise it's difficult (and time-wasting) to try to figure out exactly which font is being used on a page.
